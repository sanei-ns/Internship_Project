\section{tcpStates}\label{s:tcpStates}

\subsection{Description}
The tcpStates plugin tracks the actual state of a TCP connection, by analyzing the flags set in the packet header. The plugin recognizes and reports non-compliant behavior.

\subsection{Configuration Flags}
None.
%The following flags can be used to control the output of the plugin:
%\begin{longtable}{ccl}
%    \toprule
%    {\bf Name} & {\bf Default} & {\bf Description} \\
%    \midrule\endhead%
%    {\tt TCPSTATES\_PRINT} & 1 & Whether (1) or not (0) to output the state\\
%    \bottomrule
%\end{longtable}

\subsection{Flow File Output}
The tcpStates plugin outputs the following columns:
\begin{longtable}{lll}
    \toprule
    {\bf Column} & {\bf Type} & {\bf Description}\\
    \midrule\endhead%
    {\tt\nameref{tcpStates}} & H8 & TCP state machine anomalies\\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{tcpStates}\label{tcpStates}
The {\tt tcpStates} column is to be interpreted as follows:
\begin{longtable}{rl}
    \toprule
    {\bf tcpStates} & {\bf Description} \\
    \midrule\endhead%
    {\tt 0x01} & Malformed connection establishment \\
    {\tt 0x02} & Malformed teardown \\
    {\tt 0x04} & Malformed flags during established connection \\
    {\tt 0x08} & Packets detected after teardown \\
    {\tt 0x10} & Packets detected after reset \\
    {\tt 0x40} & Reset from sender \\
    {\tt 0x80} & Potential evil behavior (scan)\\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Flow Timeouts}
The tcpStates plugin also changes the timeout values of a flow according to its recognized state:
\begin{longtable}{llr}
    \toprule
    {\bf State} & {\bf Description} & {\bf Timeout (seconds)} \\
    \midrule\endhead%
    New & Three way handshake is encountered & 120 \\
    Established & Connection established & 610 \\
    Closing & Hosts are about to close the connection & 120 \\
    Closed & Connection closed & 10 \\
    Reset & Connection reset encountered by one of hosts & 0.1 \\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsubsection{Differences to the Host TCP State Machines}
The plugin state machine (\reff{fig:tcpstates}) and the state machines usually implemented in hosts differ in some cases. Major differences are caused by the benevolence of the plugin. For example, if a connection has not been established in a correct way, the plugin treats the connection as established, but sets the {\em malformed connection establishment} flag. The reasons for this benevolence are the following:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A flow might have been started before invocation of Tranalyzer2.
    \item A flow did not finish before Tranalyzer2 terminated.
    \item Tranalyzer2 did not detect every packet of a connection, for example due to a router misconfiguration.
    \item Flows from malicious programs may show suspicious behavior.
    \item Packets may be lost {\bf after} being captured by Tranalyzer2 but {\bf before} they reached the opposite host.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Plugin Report Output}
The aggregated \nameref{tcpStates} anomalies is reported.
