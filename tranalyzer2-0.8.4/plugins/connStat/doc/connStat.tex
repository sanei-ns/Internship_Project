\section{connStat}\label{s:connStat}

\subsection{Description}
The connStat plugin counts the connections between different IPs and ports per flow and during the pcap lifetime
in order to produce an operational picture for anomaly detection. %This plugin is more elaborate as connectionCounter
%because it uses the findex to determine which flow started the communication, but uses more hash space.

\subsection{Dependencies}

\subsubsection{Other Plugins}
If the \tranrefpl{basicFlow} plugin is loaded, then the country of the IPs with the most connections is displayed in the final report.

%connStat must {\bf never} be loaded in conjunction with connection counter because then all global statistics for the end report is wrong.
%\traninput{file} % use this command to input files
%\traninclude{file} % use this command to include files

%\tranimg{image} % use this command to include an image (must be located in a subfolder ./img/)

\subsection{Configuration Flags}
The following flags can be used to control the output of the plugin:
\begin{longtable}{lcl}
    \toprule
    {\bf Name} & {\bf Default} & {\bf Description} \\
    \midrule\endhead%
    {\tt CS\_HSDRM}   & 1 & decrement IP counters when flows die \\
    {\tt CS\_SDIPMAX} & 1 & 0: number of src dst IP connnections \\
                      &   & 1: IP src dst connection with the highest count\\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Flow File Output}
The connStat plugin outputs the following columns:
\begin{longtable}{lll}
    \toprule
    {\bf Column} & {\bf Type} & {\bf Description} \\
    \midrule\endhead%
    {\tt connSip}     & U32 & Number of unique source IPs\\
    {\tt connDip}     & U32 & Number of unique destination IPs\\
    {\tt connSipDip}  & U32 & Number of connections between source and destination IPs\\
    {\tt connSipDprt} & U32 & Number of connections between source IP and destination port \\
    {\tt connF}       &   F & the f number, experimental: connSipDprt/connSip \\
    \bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Plugin Report Output}
The following information is reported:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Number of unique source IPs
    \item Number of unique destination IPs
    \item Number of unique source/destination IPs connections
    \item Max unique number of source IP / destination port connections
    \item IP prtcon/sdcon, prtcon/scon
    \item Source IP with the max connections
    \item Destination IP with max connections
\end{itemize}
