# Mapping between Tranalyzer column names and other program names
#
# Note that if a column name is already defined as a function in tawk, then
# the column name will be prefixed with an underscore, e.g., proto -> proto_
#
# The following naming conventions is used:
#   _my_t2ColName = other_prog_col_name # Column description
