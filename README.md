# Internship_Project
Network_Traffic_Anomalies_Detection
# Goal  : 
      Applying KNN Clustering to a Dataset Describing Network Traffic .
# Tools : 
      Wireshark         : (GUI Version) Sniffing and Capturing Network Packets in GCT Corp. -> Generating a __pcap__ file .
      
      Tranalyzer        : Given a Netflow Sniffed File, (eg. pcap) Tranalyzer is a powerfull tool capable of Extracting 
                          Basic, Valuable, & Precise Information about the Netflow, It generates key parameters 
                          and Statistics from IP traces.
      
      Jupyter Notebook  : It provides an environment, where you can document your code, run it, 
                          look at the outcome,visualize data and see the results without leaving the environment.
                          This makes it a handy tool for performing end to end data science workflows â€“ data cleaning,
                          statistical modeling, building and training machine learning models, visualizing data, 
                          and many,  many other uses.
